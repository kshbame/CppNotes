# Literals

- Reference - 'https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/constants/'

1. Literals are the most obvious constants. Used to express values in code.
2. Literal constants can be classified into: integer, floating-point, characters, strings, Boolean, pointers, and user-defined literals.
3. However, certain suffixes may be appended to a literal to specify a different type such as u(or U), l(or L), ll(or LL), f(or F), d( or L).
4. Char literals are represented in single quotes.
5. String literals are represented in double quotes.
